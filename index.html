                <h2>Week 1</h2>
                <p>During this week I took time to get my bearings before setting up my GitHub repository for this webpage you're currently viewing.
                    This along with my studying was how my first week was spent.
                </p>

                <h2>Week 2</h2>
                <p>On this week was a bit slower as most of it was spent on zybook studying how to make use of Html and CSS.
                    What I learned made <strong>Big</strong> improvements on how I understood the elements in Html. 
                    I also worked on how I would design my webpage, the prototype design being more simplified than the version you're seeing below.

                <p>This week is where I began working on my actual webpage and it's look along with creating a way to navigate the conents of the page.
                    the buttons you see on the screen (which I hope you've taken time to test out) was what I came up with.

                <p>On this week I had to take time to audit this website in order to understand what I needed to complete for my final draft of my website.
                    progress is going well for the most part though it is slow due to personal elements in my own life.

                <h2>Week 5</h2>
                <p>Week 5 was undoubtable the most difficult week so far for me. Throughout the entirety of this module, I struggled to grasp a lot of the concepts
                    in Javascript. The most difficult of the subjects being loops and functions. Needing to remember the sequence in which I need for the loop to execute
                    while also doing the math to ensure it executed correctly made for a exhausting endeavor when coupled with my busy schedule this week. Even now I still wonder
                    if I have a grasp of the struture of them.
